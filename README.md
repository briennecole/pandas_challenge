# Charter vs. District
As is typically expected, Charter schools are smaller in student population and higher performance scores. I would surmise (but don't have the data in this set to say for certain) that this is due to better (smaller) student to teacher ratios. That would be one bit of information that I think could be very helpful to our analysis.

# School Size
Similar and potentially related to the Charter vs. District observation above, larger school size appears to be directly correlated negatively with all of the performance metrics analyzed in this data set. The greater the student population bucket, the lower the average scores in each category (math, reading, percent passing in each and percent overall passing).(See table below)
